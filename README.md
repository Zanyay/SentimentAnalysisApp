Thanks for checking out the app!

PLEASE NOTE THAT CURRENTLY YOUR TRAINING DATA DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY SAVE WHEN YOU QUIT THE APP. MAKE SURE TO EXPORT TO
.CSV BEFORE YOU CLOSE THE APPLICATION IF YOU WISH TO SAVE/REUSE YOUR TRAINING DATA.

You can add your own training data by importing a .csv document with the data on it. The best way to do so is with Excel or Google Sheets.
make sure it follows this format:
Sentence            Sentiment
[your text here]    [sentiment here]
[your text here]    [sentiment here]
[your text here]    [sentiment here]
[your text here]    [sentiment here]
[your text here]    [sentiment here]
[your text here]    [sentiment here]
...

You can either import an audio file (make sure speech is as clear as possible) and analyze the translation, or you can just
analyze text on the text analysis tab directly, if you'd prefer to type the text. The audio file must be .wav

To add to your prompt to the training data, select the sentiment it is supposed to be and then press the "add data" button. It
should then appear in the "view training data" tab. Make sure you hit analyze first, before adding it to the training data.

The 'about' tab explains the different methods of Sentiment Analysis used by our program.

The 'numbers' tab explains how the program got to its confidence scores.
